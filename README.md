Hi, I’m Tanusha (pronouns: she/her/hers).

I help businesses make smarter decisions with data.
I’ve worked across Adtech, Retail, and Data Warehousing, using tools like Python (Pandas, pySpark, scikit-learn), Tableau, and Power BI.

I'm building this space to share the datasets, code, and ideas I pick up as I go.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me lifting weights 🏋️‍♀️ or hanging out with my friends.
