Hi, I’m Tanusha,

I help businesses make smarter decisions with data.
I’ve worked across Adtech, Retail, and Data Warehousing, using tools like Python (Pandas, pySpark, scikit-learn), Tableau, and Power BI.

I've transitioned from Data to Product but resuming this space to explore more ideas and upskill. Wish me luck.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me lifting weights 🏋️‍♀️ or hanging out with my friends.
