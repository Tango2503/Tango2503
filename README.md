Hi, I’m Tanusha

I help businesses make smarter decisions with data.
I’ve worked across Adtech, Retail, and Data Warehousing, using tools like Python (Pandas, pySpark, scikit-learn), Tableau, and Power BI.

I transitioned from Data to Product ~3 years ago but resuming this space to explore more ideas and continue upskilling. Wish me luck.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me lifting weights 🏋️‍♀️ or hanging out with my friends.
